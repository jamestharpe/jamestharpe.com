These practices organize schedules, reminders, task lists, ideas, and other organizational artifacts into a single notebook. Though journals are typically handwritten, digital journals can also benefit from the organizational methods and practices of bullet journaling.</p>\n<iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/fm15cmYU0IM\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n<h2>Structure of a Bullet Journal</h2>\n<p>A bullet journal is made up of collections. A <strong>collection</strong> is a set of closely related information. A bullet journal is made up of four core collections; however, more collections can be added based on the individual journaler's needs.</p>\n<h3>Core Bullet Journal Collections</h3>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Index.</strong> A chronologically ordered list of all the collections in the journal, except the daily log collections.</li>\n<li><strong>Future Log.</strong> A calendar of events and tasks that will occur outside the current month.</li>\n<li><strong>Monthly Log.</strong> A specialized collection to organize the events and tasks of a particular month. Minimally, it consists of the</li>\n<li><strong>Daily Log.</strong> A place to rapid-log tasks, events, and notes as they occur throughout the day.</li>\n</ol>\n<h3>Custom Collections</h3>\n<p><strong>Custom collections</strong> are created to meet some specific need. For example, to plan a project or to track a fitness routine.</p>\n<h2>Core Bullet Journal Practices</h2>\n<p>The Bullet Journal website contains a <a href=\"https://bulletjournal.com/pages/learn\">complete introduction to core bullet journaling practices</a></p>\n<h2>Rapid Logging</h2>\n<p><strong>Rapid logging</strong> is the practice of quickly jotting-down notes in a bulleted-list format, typically within the daily log. Specialized bullets and signifiers are used to distinguish between different types of notes. Types of notes are typically tasks, events, or information; however the journaler may choose to invent their own types of notes as well.</p>\n<h3>Common Bullets</h3>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Bullet</th>\n<th>Term</th>\n<th>Definition</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td><code class=\"language-text\">•</code></td>\n<td>Task</td>\n<td>Something that needs to be completed</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><code class=\"language-text\">o</code></td>\n<td>Event</td>\n<td>Something that happened or is scheduled to happen</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><code class=\"language-text\">—</code></td>\n<td>Information</td>\n<td>Something worth remembering.

Do this at either the very beginning or very end of each day.</p>\n<h3>Monthly Migrations</h3>\n<p>At the end of each month, create a new <strong>monthly log</strong> for the month ahead. Start by creating the layout for the next month, then review the previous month to:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Mark completed tasks with <code class=\"language-text\">✖</code>.</li>\n<li><del>Cross-out</del> irrelevant tasks, notes, and events.</li>\n<li>For tasks you plan to complete next month, mark them as migrated (<code class=\"language-text\">&gt;</code>) and add them to the next month's task list or to the relevant <strong>custom collection</strong>.</li>\n<li>For tasks you plan to complete after next month, move them to the future log and mark them as scheduled (<code class=\"language-text\">&lt;</code>).</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The goal is that all relevant tasks have been copied to the next month's task list, the future log, or a custom collection.</p>"}
