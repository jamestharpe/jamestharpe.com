A <strong>transition</strong> is the change from one state to another given a set of inputs.</p>\n<p>There are two types of state machines: Finite, and infinite. A finite state machine (FSM) has a finite number of states and actions whereas an infinite state machine has an infinite number of states and/or actions. Generally, the term \"state machine\" refers to a finite state machine.</p>\n<p>State machines can be depicted formally in a visual format, which makes them useful for describing complex systems.</p>\n<h2>State Machine Resources</h2>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://statecharts.github.io/what-is-a-state-machine.html\">What is a State Machine?</a></li>\n</ul>","fields":{"slug":"/state-machines/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"State Machines","tags":["math","computer-science"]}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/state-machines/"}},"staticQueryHashes":["2270328656","3794076007","80858887"]}
