Turbidity can also influence desaturation. The greater the turbidity of the water, the more quickly colors are absorbed. The content of the suspended particles can also impact the visible color spectrum; for example, algae often shades objects in the water green. Shallow turbid water can therefore sometimes appear to have less color than deep, clear water.\"), mdx(\"h2\", null, \"Hearing underwater\"), mdx(\"p\", null, \"Sounds typically heard while scuba diving include your own breathing, boats passing overhead, and clicks from fish that are feeding. Sound travels roughly 4 to 5 times faster underwater than it does through air due to waters density, which is roughly 800 times that of air. This makes the directionality of sound difficult to discern because sound waves arrive at both ears at virtually the same time. This can lead to danger, particularly because of the difficulty in determining the location and direction of boats operating nearby. Thus, the best thing to do while underwater and hearing a boat is to stay underwater at a safe depth away from the surface until the boat is no longer audible.\"), mdx(\"h2\", null, \"Body temperature underwater\"), mdx(\"p\", null, \"Water conducts heat away from the body approximately 25 times faster than air, which is why a comfortable air temperature can feel uncomfortably cold in water at the same temperature.

These influences can cause longshore currents to sometimes reverse direction, so awareness and careful planning are important when dealing with longshore currents.

These currents are known for quickly pulling beach-goers, swimmers, and divers out to sea. Rip currents are formed by water flowing through the narrowing of passageways the water flows through, such as between sandbars or breaks in a coral reef.

If a surge is strong, divers are involuntarily moved by the motion of the water and have little control over the direction in which they move. To avoid the danger of being thrown against rock or coral formations during intense surge, it's best to move to deeper water where surge is less severe.\"), mdx(\"h2\", null, \"Diving with aquatic life\"), mdx(\"p\", null, \"As long as they are out of arms reach, underwater animals tend to ignore humans; unlike on land where most animals will flee or avoid human presence. This ability to get close when diving means divers must take special care not to disturb or disrupt wildlife. A diver should therefore be aware of where their body and equipment are in proximity to their surroundings at all time to avoid disturbing the underwater environment.

To avoid attacks, divers should not feed, corner, grab, or act aggressively toward any animal. This includes not putting hands blindly into holes or around corners.
