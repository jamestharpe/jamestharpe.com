Gears can be used to create <a href=\"../mechanical-advantage/\">mechanical advantage</a> equal to the ratio of the driver gear over the driven gear; this ratio is also referred to as the <strong>gear ratio</strong>.</p>\n<h2>Gear Terminology</h2>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Part</th>\n<th>Definition</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>Axis</td>\n<td>Where the shaft passes through</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Cog</td>\n<td>A tooth on a wheel</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Cylinder</td>\n<td>The \"wheel\" portion of the gear</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Driver Gear</td>\n<td>A gear rotated by a power source</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Driven Gear</td>\n<td>A gear rotated by a driver gear</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Gear ratio</td>\n<td>The ratio of the sizes of two gears, typically the driver gear over the driven gear</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Gear train</td>\n<td>The combination of two or more gears</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Pitch Circle</td>\n<td>The circumference the the gear, measured at the point of force between two meshed gears</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Tooth</td>\n<td>The lever protruding from the cylinder or cone</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<h2>Video Introduction to Gears</h2>\n<iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/D_i3PJIYtuY\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n<h2>Resources for Learning About Gears</h2>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.instructables.com/Basic-Gear-Mechanisms/\">Basic Gear Mechanisms</a></li>\n</ul>","fields":{"slug":"/gears/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Gears","tags":["mechanical-engineering","torque","mechanical-advantage","angular-motion"]}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/gears/"}},"staticQueryHashes":["2270328656","3794076007","80858887"]}
