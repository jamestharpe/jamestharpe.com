Their motives are in many cases consonant with science. If their culture as not given them all the tools they need to pursue this great quest, let us temper our criticism with kindness, None ofd us comes fully equipped.\"  </p>\n<p>--Carl Sagan</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"One of my favorite cartoons shows a fortune-teller scrutinizing the mark's palm and gravely concluding, 'You are very gullible.'\"  </p>\n<p>--Carl Sagan</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"Many pseudoscientific and New Age belief systems emerge out of dissatisfaction with conventional values and perspectives - and are therefore themselves a kind of skepticism.\"  </p>\n<p>--Carl Sagan</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"The world of the paranormal may appear less as a silly turn toward irrationalism and more as an idiom through which the segments of society express their conflicts, dilemmas, and identities...\"</p>\n<p>--Carl Sagan</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"We must not believe the many, who say that only free people ought to be educated, but we should rather believe the philosophers who say that only the educated are free.\"</p>\n<p>--Epictetus, Discourses</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"Why should we subsidize intellectual curiosity?\"</p>\n<p>--Ronald Reagan, 1980</p>\n<p>...</p>\n<p>\"There is nothing which can better deserve our patronage than the promotion of science and literature.

It is estimated (by the American media expert Ben Bagdikian) that fewer than two dozen corporations control more than half 'of the global business in daily newspapers, magazines, televisions, books and movies.' The proliferation of cable television channels, heap long-distance telephone calls, fax machines, computer bulletin boards and networks, inexpensive computer self-publishing, and surviving instances of the traditional liberal arts university curriculum are trends tha might owk in the opposite direction.\"</p>\n<p>--Carl Sagan</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"It is not the function of our government to keep the citizen from falling into error; it is the function of the citizen to keep the government from falling into error.\"</p>\n<p>--Robert H.

If the opinion is right, we are robbed of the 'opportunity of exchanging error for truth'; and if it's wrong, we are deprived of a deeper understanding of the truth in 'its collision with error.'\"</p>\n<p>--Carl Sagan</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"... a union of government and religion tends to destroy government and degrade religion.\"</p>\n<p>-- Justice Black, Supreme Court, <a href=\"https://www.uscourts.gov/educational-resources/educational-activities/facts-and-case-summary-engel-v-vitale\">Engel v.
