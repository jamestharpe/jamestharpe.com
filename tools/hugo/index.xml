      <description>Create a Backend for a Static Frontend We recently launched the Crawlity website which, like jamestharpe.com, uses Hugo to generate a static site. There&amp;rsquo;s no database or template engine running on the server - just static files. Unlike jamestharpe.com, crawlity.com needs a back-end to accept contact form submissions. So how does one create a dynamic back-end for a static, &amp;ldquo;serverless&amp;rdquo; front-end?
Short answer: With the Serverless Framework!
Serverless Framework, or simply &amp;ldquo;Serverless&amp;rdquo;, is a provider-agnostic framework for defining the functions and events that make up your application.</description>

      <description>Moving my Website to Hugo I&amp;rsquo;ve decided to move my website off of WordPress and on to a static site generator. After building sites for several clients using Jekyll, I thought it would be nice to try something new.
Since my website has been very neglected, most of the content is outdated so I&amp;rsquo;m not going to bother moving much of it over. If I were, I might try the wordpress-to-hugo-exporter exporter.</description>
