# Storybook

**Storybook** is an [open-source software](open-source-software.md) tool that enables [developers](software-engineering.md) to design and build UI components in an isolated, interactive environment and showcase them in an interactive catalog. It supports several frameworks including [React](react.md), [Vue](vue.md), [Angular](angular.md), and others. In Storybook, each component is accompanied by its 'story' which details its design and functionality.
