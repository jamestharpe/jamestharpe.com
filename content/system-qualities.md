# System Qualities and Nonfunctional Requirements (NFRs)

A **system quality**, sometimes known as a **nonfunctional requirement (NFR)**, is a type of [requirement](requirements.md) that defines constraints on how [software is engineered](software-engineering.md) to ensure a baseline level of quality. System qualities are often integrated into the [SDLC](sdlc.md) as part of the "definition of done".

## Categories of System Qualities and NFRs

Common categories of system qualities are: 

* Availability
* Disaster recovery
* Legal/regulatory compliance
* Maintainability
* Observability
* Performance
* Reliability
* Security
* Scalability
* Usability
