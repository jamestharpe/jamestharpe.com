# Synthetic Minority Oversampling Technique (SMOTE)

**Synthetic Minority Oversampling Technique (SMOTE)** is a method used in [machine learning](machine-learning.md) model training that synthesizes new examples of a minority class to compensate for a severe class imbalance in which there are too few minority class examples to effectively learn the decision boundary.
