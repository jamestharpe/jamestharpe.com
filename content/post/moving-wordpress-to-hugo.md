# Moving my Blog from WordPress to Hugo

I've decided to move [my website](https://www.jamestharpe.com/) off of [WordPress](https://wordpress.org/) and on to a static site generator. After building several sites using [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/), I thought it would be nice to try something new. Though I liked Jekyll overall, I wasn't a fan of the liquid syntax and site generation for large sites was too slow and required a lot of tweaking to achieve a reasonable code/test iteration pace.

## Enter Hugo
[Hugo](http://gohugo.io/) purports to be _fast_, so let's hope that as this site grows, Hugo will be up to the task of allowing me to work quickly.
