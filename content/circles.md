# Circles

A circle is a shape on a plane in which all points are equally distant from the center.

## Terms and Symbols Related to Circles

| Term          | Symbol | Definition                                                                                                                   |
| ------------- | ------ | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Area          | $a$    | The amount of space occupied by the surface of the circle                                                                    |
| Circumference | $c$    | The perimeter of a circle                                                                                                    |
| Diameter      | $d$    | The distance of a straight line from one point on a circle to the opposite point on the circle and passes through the center |
| Pi            | $\pi$  | The ratio of a circle's circumference to its diameter. Equal to about $22/7$ or $3.14$                                       |
| Radius        | $r$    | The distance from the center to a point on the edge of a circle                                                              |

## Formulas to Find Properties of Circles

### Area of a Circle

$a = \pi r^2$

$a = \pi (d/2)^2$

### Circumference of a Circle

$c = 2 \pi r$

$c = d \pi$

### Diameter of a Circle

$d = 2r$

$d = c/\pi$

### Radius of a Circle

$r = d / 2$

$r = c/2\pi$
