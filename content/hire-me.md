# Nerd for Hire

Wouldn’t it be great if you had an extra brain to handle complex projects that you don’t have time for? Well, you can’t! So go with the next best thing: me.

I can help with virtually any project related to software development, web development, cloud management, marketing automation, and agile project management. Through my company, [Onlinico](https://www.onlini.co/), I can take on projects of virtually any size.

## Services for Businesses

Here are some things I can do for your business:

### Build, Host, and Maintain your Website

Whether you're starting from scratch, have a long-neglected website that needs refreshing, or something in between, I can get your lead-generating or ecommerce website up-and-running. All the websites I deliver are fast and easy to maintain.

Building your website consists of three basic steps:

1. **Design:** I'll work with you to ensure brand consistency, broad device compatability (responsive), and low-friction conversions are all baked in to the design. If you have an existing website, I'll audit it to identify specific opportunities to improve user experience and conversions.
1. **Build:** I'll provide you with a user-friendly back-end to make maintaining your site surprisingly easy, and an SEO-friendly front-end to make your site easy to find.
1. **Launch:** I'll thoroughly test your website for functionality, browser compataibility, and device compataibility. You'll also get free support for 30 days, just in case.

You're welcome to host your website anywhere, but if you host with Onlinico you'll get:

* Separate staging and production environments
* SSL Encryption
* Content Delivery Network
* Daily backups

Finally, I can help keep your website in tip-top shape with a maintenance plan. Maintenance plans can be customized to include any or all of the following:

* Pro-active monitoring and support for site outages, hacks, and accidental changes
* Regular maintenance to keep software, plug-ins, javascript libraries, and other compoents up to date
* Ad-hoc requests, from simple content changes to major new features

### Website Quick Wins

Need to get something done on your website quickly, without a rebuild? Here are some quick-wins I can give you, usually in just a few days:

* Google Tag Manager installation
* Google Analytics installation
* Google Search console setup and configuration
* Social meda (Facebook, Twitter, etc) integration
* Transfer to a new host
* Install an SSL certificate
* Implement a Content Delivery Network (CDN)
* Improve site speed through minification and compression
* Plug-in and Theme upgrades
* Scan for broken links and common SEO issues
* Test for browser compatability

### Mobile App Development

Mobile apps are a great way to increase engagement with your business or monetize your expertise. If you have an app idea, or even if you *need* an app idea, I'd be happy to help ideate, design, build, and publish your mobile app on iOS and Android.
