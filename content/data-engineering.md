# Data Engineering

**Data engineering** is the specialized application of [software-engineering](software-engineering.md) practices to collect, transform, and store data for [analysis](data-analysis.md) and [predictive modeling](data-science.md).

Data engineering practices may overlap significantly with [business intelligence](business-intelligence.md), [data science](data-science.md), and [data analysis](data-analysis.md) practices. However, the primary focus of data engineering is to develop the infrastructure and automation required to store and access the data as [required](requirements.md) by the business.
