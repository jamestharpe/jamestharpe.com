# ROAM: Resolved, Owned, Accepted, Mitigated

**ROAM** is a model to clearly articulate the risks associated with a [project](project-management.md). The term "ROAM" is derived from the model, which specifies a status of resolved, owned, accepted, or mitigated for a given risk.

**Resolved** means that the risk no longer poses a threat to the project and therefore no further action is required.

**Owned** indicates that the risk presents a threat to the project scope, timeline, or budget and an owner has been assigned to mitigate or otherwise address the risk.

**Accepted** risks are risks which cannot or should not be resolved.

**Mitigated** risks still threaten a project but have an acceptable plan in place for mitigation, should the risk arise.
