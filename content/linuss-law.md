# Linus's Law

> Given a large enough beta-tester and co-developer base, almost every problem will be characterized quickly and the fix obvious to someone.

This law was coined by [Eric Raymond](eric-raymond.md) in [The Cathedral and The Bazaar](https://cse.unl.edu/~cbourke/ComputerScienceII/docs/CathedralAndBazaar.pdf) and named in honor of [Linus Torvalds](linus-torvalds.md).

It is more succinctly and less formally stated as:

> Given enough eyeballs, all bugs are shallow
