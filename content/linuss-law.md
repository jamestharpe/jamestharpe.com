> Given a large enough beta-tester and co-developer base, almost every problem will be characterized quickly and the fix obvious to someone.

This law was coined by Eric Raymond in [The Cathedral and The Bazaar](https://monoskop.org/images/e/e0/Raymond_Eric_S_The_Cathedral_and_the_Bazaar_rev_ed.pdf) and named in honor of Linus Torvalds.

It is more succinctly and less formally stated as:

> Given enough eyeballs, all bugs are shallow
