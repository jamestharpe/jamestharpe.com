# Batch and offline learning

**Batch learning** is a [type](ml-types.md) of [machine learning](machine-learning.md) that requires a "complete" dataset for training and cannot be trained incrementally, in contrast to [online learning](ml-online-learning.md). Batch learning is often referred to as **offline learning** because model training is performed in non-production environments (hence they are "offline").
