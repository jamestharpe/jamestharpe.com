# Formal sciences

**Formal sciences** are [sciences](science.md) that are concerned with abstract concepts and formal systems, rather than [natural](natural-sciences.md) or [social](social-sciences.md) processes. Formal sciences use deductive reasoning to derive conclusions from established axioms, and are often characterized by their use of rigorous mathematical methods. Common examples of formal sciences include [mathematics](math.md), [computer science](computer-science.md), and logic.
