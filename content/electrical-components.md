# Electrical Components

**Electrical components**, sometimes referred to as **electrical elements**, are the discreet parts of an [electrical circuit](circuits.md) that modify or manipulate the [flow of electricity](current.md). Components are made up of **terminals**, points where the [conductors](conductance.md) come to an end (or "terminate"), and **leads**, conductors (typically wires or metals) which join two points electrically.
