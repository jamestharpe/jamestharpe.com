# You Aren't Gonna Need it (YAGNI)

**You Aren't Gonna Need it (YAGNI)** is a mnemonic to help limit scope in [requirements](requirements.md). YAGNI advises that there's no point in building capabilities into [products](product-management.md) until there is an observable need. Though applicable to virtually any [engineering](engineering.md) project, YAGNI is especially applicable to [software](software-engineering.md) because it's so easy to change compared to other types of engineering projects.
