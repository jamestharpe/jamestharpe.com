# PostgreSQL

**PostgreSQL**, often referred to as simply **postgres**, is an [open-source software](open-source-software.md) [relational database](relational-databases.md), known for its extensibility. PostgreSQL allows developers to define their own data types, and build custom functions from [programming languages](computer-languages.md) other than SQL.
