# Microservices

Microservices is an [architectural style](software-architecture.md) for developing and deploying software applications as a [distributed system](distributed-systems.md). Services can be separated for various business, such as differing incentives or decision makers across teams (see also: [Conway's Law](conways-law.md)), and/or technical reasons, such as different data stores, release schedules, or traffic patterns.
