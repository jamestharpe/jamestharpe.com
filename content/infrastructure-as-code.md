# Infrastructure as Code (IaC)

**Infrastructure as Code (IaC)** is a technique often associated with [DevOps](devops.md) to manage infrastructure (networks, virtual machines, managed cloud services) with code. Code is typically [versioned](version-control.md) like any other source code, and deployed via [CI/CD](ci-cd.md) pipelines.

Key benefit of an effective IaC practice include:

* Simplifies collaboration on infrastructure
* Predictable, repeatable, consistent environments
* Re-usable infrastructure components
* Code also serves as documentation
