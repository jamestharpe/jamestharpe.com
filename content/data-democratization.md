# Data Democratization

**Data democratization** is the practice and process of making [business intelligence](business-intelligence.md) data and insights accessible, usable, and valuable to as many people as possible, regardless of their technical expertise or background.  Data democratization can be achieved through a variety of means, including the use of self-service analytics tools, [data visualization](data-visualizations.md) platforms, and data literacy programs.

The most common challenges to data democratization include:

* **Data accessibility:** Ensuring that data is readily available and easy to find for those who need it, while respecting privacy, [security](cybersecurity.md), and ethical concerns.
* **Data literacy**: Empowering people to understand and interpret data by providing them with the necessary tools, resources, and training.
* **User-friendly tools**: Providing user-friendly software that allows non-technical users to explore, visualize, and analyze data without requiring advanced skills.
* **Collaboration**: Providing collaboration spaces and opportunities that enable knowledge-sharing that fosters innovation and improves decision-making.
