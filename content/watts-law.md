# Watt's Law

**Watt's Law**, sometimes called the **Power Law**, describes the relationship between [power](power.md) ($P$), [current](current.md) ($I$), and [voltage](voltage.md) ($V$), so that power is defined as:

$P=IV$

Given tha values for any two variables, we solve for the third so that **voltage**, electrical potential energy, is defined as:

$V=P/I$

And current, which is the flow of [electricity](electricity.md), is defined as:

$I=P/V$

## Power and Watts

**Power** is measured in watts. One **watt** ($W$) is equal to one [joule](physics.md) ($J$) per second ($s$), or $W = \frac{J}{s}$. Another way to put it is, a watt is the amount of electricity required to accelerate 1kg by 1 meter per second squared (a joule) over 1 second. In other words, a watt is "how much work can be done per second".

## History

The terms watt and Watt's Law are named after [James Watt](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Watt), best known for his work to improve the steam engine.
