# Watt's Law

**Watt's Law**, sometimes called the **Power Law**, describes the relationship between power ($P$), current ($I$), and voltage ($V$):

$P=IV$

Given tha values for any two variables, we solve for the third, so that:

$V=\frac{P}{I}$

And:

$I=\frac{P}{V}$

## Power and Watts

**Power** is measured in watts. One **watt** ($W$) is equal to one joule ($J$) per second ($s$), or $W = \frac{J}{s}$. Another way to put it is, a watt is the amount of electricity required to accelerate 1kg by 1 meter per second squared (a joule) over 1 second. In other words, a watt is "how much work can be done per second".
