# Software Development Lifecycle (SDLC)

A **Software Development Lifecycle (SDLC)** is a process of conceiving, planning, building, deploying, using, and retiring software applications. SDLC methods can vary widely, but generally share goals around customer satisfaction, quality, and efficiency. The "best" SDLC is "what works for you" or "what works for your organization" and is dependent on a wide variety of factors such as industry, culture, and expertise.
