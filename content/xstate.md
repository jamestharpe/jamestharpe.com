# XState

[XState](https://xstate.js.org/) is a JavaScript framework for managing [state machines](state-machines.md) and [statecharts](statecharts.md).

## Example XState Project: Gas Pump

The [**gas pump example project**](https://codesandbox.io/s/fervent-noyce-yhnrc) uses XState to implement a basic gas pump as if it were an integration of three separate applications, each using a statechart unknown to the other applications, but potentially dependent on them. This was important to prove conceptually for potential use in a multi-team enterprise setting.
