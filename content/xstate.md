# XState

[XState](https://xstate.js.org/) is an [open-source](open-source-software.md) [JavaScript](javascript.md) framework by [Stately](https://stately.ai/) for managing [state machines](state-machines.md) and [statecharts](statecharts.md) and includes the ability to treat them as [actors](actor-model.md).

## Using XState with [TypeScript](typescript.md)

XState can enforce type safety through automatic type generation. For an overview, see **Is XState good with TypeScript?** in the following video.
