# Economics

**Economics** is a [social science](social-sciences.md) that seeks to understand and explain human behavior, especially with respect to how scarce resources are produced, distributed, and consumed by individuals, businesses, governments, and societies. Economics draws on insights from [psychology](psychology.md), [sociology](sociology.md), and political science to better understand human behavior and decision-making in economic contexts.

Economics can be split into two major categories: Microeconomics and macroeconomics. **Microeconomics** is the study of behaviors of individual actors and entities that makeup an economy whereas **macroeconomics** is the study of economies in aggregate.
