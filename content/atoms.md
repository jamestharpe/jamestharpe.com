# Atoms

**Atoms** are the basic units of chemical elements. Atoms themselves are made of positively [charged](charge.md) particles called protons, negatively charged particles called electrons, and neutrons which have atomic weight but no charge.

**Elements** are chemical substances composed of only one type of atom, whereas substances composed of multiple types of atoms are called **compounds**. **Molecules** are the basic units of compounds and are made of two or more atoms. Matter made of multiple molecules is called a **mixture**.
