# Version Control

In [software engineering](software-engineering.md), **version control** is a system for managing changes to sets of files to aid in collaboration and to recall specific versions of files or entire projects at later times. Generally, version control allows you to restore files back to a previous state, compare changes over time, see who made each change, and see when each change was made.
