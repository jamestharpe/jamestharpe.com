# Simple Machines

**Simple machines** are the most basic forms of machines. Though [physics](physics.md) only recognizes the lever and the inclined plane as the basis for all machines, [mechanical engineers](mechanical-engineering.md) tend to think in terms of six simple machines: the [lever](levers.md), the block and tackle (pulley), the wheel and axel, the inclined plane, the screw, and the wedge.
