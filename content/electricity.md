# Electricity

Electricity the form of energy (the ability to do work) that results from charged particles (electrons, protons).

## Measures of Electricity

### Stored Electricity: Voltage and Volts

Stored electricity is called voltage and is measured in volts. More precisely, **voltage** is the difference in electric potential energy between two points.

One **volt** is equal to 1 joule ($J$, see [physics](physics.md)) per 1 coulomb ($C$), or $V = \frac{J}{C}$. A **coulomb** is a quantity of electrical charge, approximately equal to $6.2415090744 \cdot 10^{18}$ elementary charges (i.e. electrons).

Another way to put it is, a volt is the amount of electricity required to accelerate 1kg by 1 meter per second squared (a joule) for 1 second (resulting in a displacement of $1m$), divided by the quantity of electrical charges (coulombs). In other words, a volt is "how much work can be done per coulomb".

### Flowing Electricity: Current and Amperes (amps)

**Current** ($I$) is the "flow" of electricity, measured in amperes or "amps" ($A$). One amp is equal to one coulomb ($C$) passing a given point in a circuit over one second ($s$), or $A = \frac{C}{s}$.

Solving for $C$, we can get a mathematical definition of coulomb: $C=As$.

### Working Electricity: Power and Watts

**Power** ($P$) is amount of work (energy transfer), measured in watts. One watt is equal to 1 joule per second, or $W=J/s$. Power can be derived from current and voltage through [watts law](watts-law.md), which states $P=IV$.

### Relationships between Volts, Amps, Ohms, and Watts

[Ohm's Law](ohms-law.md) and [Watt's Law](watts-law.md) describe the relationship between volts, amps, ohms and watts as $I = V/R$ and $P=IV$, respectively.
