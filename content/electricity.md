# Electricity

Electricity the form of energy (the ability to do work) that results from charged particles (electrons, protons).

## Measures of Electricity

### Stored Electricity: Voltage and Volts

Stored electricity is called voltage and is measured in volts. More precisely, **voltage** is the difference in electric potential energy between two points.

One **volt** is equal to 1 joule ($J$, see [physics](/physics.md)) per 1 coulomb ($C$), or $V = \frac{J}{C}$. A **coulomb** is a quantity of electrical charge, approximately equal to $6.2415090744 \cdot 10^{18}$ elementary charges (i.e. electrons).

Another way to put it is, a volt is the amount of electricity required to accelerate 1kg by 1 meter per second squared (a joule) for 1 second (resulting in a displacement of $1m$), divided by the quantity of electrical charges (coulombs). In other words, a volt is "how much work can be done per coulomb".

### Flowing Electricity: Current and Amperes (amps)

**Current** ($I$) is the "flow" of electricity, measured in amperes or "amps" ($A$). One amp is equal to one coulomb ($C$) passing a given point in a circuit over one second ($s$), or $A = \frac{C}{s}$. 

Solving for $C$, we can get a mathematical definition of coulomb: $C=As$.
