# Electricity

Electricity is the form of [energy](physics.md) (the ability to do work) that results from charged particles (electrons, protons). [**Power** ($P$)](power.md) from electricity is generated when potential electrical energy, referred to as [voltage](voltage.md), is released so that it "flows" through a conductor as a [current](current.md) where it encounters [resistance](resistance.md). This flow is mathematically described by [Ohm's Law](ohms-law.md), and the amount of power generated is described by the [Watt's Law](watts-law.md).

## Relationships between Voltage, Current, Resistance, and Watts

[Ohm's Law](ohms-law.md) and [Watt's Law](watts-law.md) describe the relationship between volts, amps, ohms and watts as $I = V/R$ and $P=IV$, respectively. These equations allow for substitutions: for example $I$ can be substituted with $V/R$ so that $P=(V/R)V$ or $P=V^2/R$.
