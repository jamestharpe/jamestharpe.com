# Dimensional modeling

**Dimensional modeling** is an approach to designing databases for [data warehousing](data-warehouses.md) that focuses on modeling data around the way users analyze and report on it to provide simplified data structures that are optimized for querying and reporting. Typically, this involves organizing data into [star schemas](star-schemas.md) that organize data into dimensions (such as time, location, and product) and facts (such as sales, revenue, and quantity) that are related to those dimensions.
