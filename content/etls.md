# Extract Transform Load (ETL)

An **Extract Transform Load (ETL)** is an automated process that _extracts_ [data](data.md) from one or more sources, _transforms_ it to meet the needs of one or more [data products](data-products.md), and _loads_ the transformed data to a host [database](databases.md) or [data warehouse](data-warehouses.md). ETLs are the building blocks of [data pipelines](data-pipelines.md).

Transformation can include splitting, combining, adding, removing, aggregating, or otherwise reshaping data to fit a particular use case or next step in a lager data pipeline.
