# Diversity

**Diversity** is the full range of salient differences between people in a group such as a team, company, or governing body. Aspects of diversity can include cohorts of education level, life experiences, abilities, race/ethnicity, sex, gender identity, sexual orientation, age, physical/mental health, or other demographic traits. 

> A simple metaphor to understand diversity is that diversity means "having a seat at the table."

A group is considered "diverse" when it has representation from each cohort in the same proportions as the larger group it belongs to. For example, a team in a department at a company should reflect the cohorts within the department, which should reflect the cohorts within the company, which should represent the cohorts within the society it is part of.
