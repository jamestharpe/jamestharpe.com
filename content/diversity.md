# Diversity

**Diversity** is the full range of salient differences between people in a group such as a team, company, or governing body. Aspects of diversity can include education level, life experiences, abilities, race/ethnicity, sex, gender identity, sexual orientation, age, physical/mental health, or other demographic traits.
