# Resistance and Ohms

**Resistance** is opposition to [current](current.md), is measured in Ohms ($Î©$), and defined by [Ohm's Law](ohms-law.md) as [voltage](voltage.md) over current, or $R = V/I$. The inverse of resistance is [conductance](conductance.md).

**Resistors** are materials that resist the flow of electricity, and thus have a high resistance (and thus a low conductance) value, hence the term ["resistor"](resistors.md) for the [electrical component](electrical-components.md) which reduce current.

## History

The term "ohm" is named after [Georg Simon Ohm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Georg_Ohm), who first derived the relationships between current, voltage, and resistance now known as Ohm's Law.
