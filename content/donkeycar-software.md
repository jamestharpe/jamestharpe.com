# Installing the Software on Our First Donkey Car

[Donkey Car](http://www.donkeycar.com/) is an opensource project for developing self-driving small scale cars. Over the weekend, my daughter and I built one!

We found the [Donkey Car docs](http://docs.donkeycar.com/) a bit difficult to follow, and just plain wrong, in a few places. Yet we managed to muddle our way through, despite a few mistakes along the way. Here's what we ended up doing.

**Part 1: Build a Donkey Car**, reviewed the parts, tools, and steps for building a Donkey Car. In this article, we'll go over installing the Donkey Car software and calibrating the controls.
