# Electrical Circuits

**Circuits** are assemblies of [electronic](electrical-engineering.md) [components](electrical-components.md). The [flow of electricity](current.md) through a circuit is described by [Ohm's Law](ohms-law.md). Electricity flows through **nodes**, also called **junctions**, which are electrical connections between components. Nodes are made up of one or more **branches**, which are the the connections between the components that make up a node; branches and components are effectivly the same.
