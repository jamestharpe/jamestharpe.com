# Flowing Electricity: Current and Amperes (amps)

**Current** ($I$) is the "flow" of electricity, measured in amperes or "amps" ($A$). One amp is equal to one coulomb ($C$) passing a given point in a circuit over one second ($s$), or $A = \frac{C}{s}$. A **coulomb** is a quantity of electrical charge, approximately equal to $6.2415090744 \cdot 10^{18}$ elementary charges (i.e. electrons or protons).

Solving for $C$, we can get a mathematical definition of coulomb: $C=As$.

Current can be derived by [Ohm's Law](ohms-law.md) as $I = V/R$.

## Direction of Current

**Conventional current** is current that "flows" in the direction that the positive charge travels and is usually what's meant when talking about "current" without specifying the type of current. Current flows in the direction that the negative charge travels is usually referred to more explicitly as **electron current**.

In [electrical engineering](electrical-engineering.md), contentional current is used for calculations even though currents are typically generated through the flow of electrons rather than protons.

Current can also "flow" in both directions simultaneously, such as in salt water. When salt is dissolved in water it forms free-floating sodium ($Na^+$) and chlorine ($Cl^-$) ions which will both respond to electric force, moving in opposite directions.
