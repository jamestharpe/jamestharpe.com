# Flowing Electricity: Current and Amperes (amps)

**Current** ($I$) is the "flow" of electricity, measured in amperes or "amps" ($A$). One amp is equal to one coulomb ($C$) passing a given point in a [circuit](circuits.md) per second ($s$), or $A = {C}/{s}$. [**Coulombs**](charge.md) are the [standard measure](si-units.md) of electrical charge quantity (i.e. electrons or protons).

Current can be derived by [Ohm's Law](ohms-law.md) as $I = V/R$.

## Direction of Current

**Conventional current** is current that "flows" in the direction that the positive charge travels and is usually what's meant when talking about "current" without specifying the type of current. Current flows in the direction that the negative charge travels is usually referred to more explicitly as **electron current**.

In [electrical engineering](electrical-engineering.md), contentional current is used for calculations even though currents are typically generated through the flow of electrons rather than protons.

Current can also "flow" in both directions simultaneously, such as in salt water. When salt is dissolved in water it forms free-floating sodium ($Na^+$) and chlorine ($Cl^-$) ions which will both respond to electric force, moving in opposite directions.
