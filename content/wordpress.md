At the core of WordPress is a theming systems that allows virtually any design to be implemented, and a plugins system that allows virtually any feature to be added. Under the hood, WordPress follows an event-driven architecture through its [Hooks API](https://developer.wordpress.org/plugins/hooks/). This allows developers to hook into various parts of the WordPress core and attach their custom functionality or alter the existing one.

WordPress also features a REST API that provides endpoints for posts, comments, terms, users, meta, and more, allowing developers to interact with sites remotely by sending and receiving JSON objects.

WordPress includes **roles based access controls (RBAC)** which  allow for granular permissions, providing a secure way to control who can access different areas of a WordPress-managed website.
