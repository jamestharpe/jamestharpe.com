# Python Poetry

**Poetry** is a [package manager](package-managers.md) for [Python](python.md) that replaces [Pip](python-pip.md) for managing packages. Notably, Poetry is capable of producing deterministic builds, separating development and production dependencies, and providing isolated virtual environments "out of the box".
