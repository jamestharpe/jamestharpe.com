The goal most CRM programs is to use direct communication channels (e.g. email, social media, phone calls) to increase sales by attracting more customers and improving the satisfaction, loyalty, and retention of existing customers through.

Most CRM programs are driven by CRM software that is used to manage customer interactions and data, including contact information, communication history, purchase history, and customer feedback. This data is used to personalize communication with customers, improve customer service, inform other marketing efforts, and ultimately build stronger, longer-lasting relationships with customers.
