# ChatGPT prompts

I've had some fun learning the art of [prompt engineering](prompt-engineering.md) recently, and developed some fun prompts that anyone can try using [ChatGPT](chatgpt.md).

## Anger translator

For those of us that can be too blunt, ChatGPT can take your stream-of-thought and translate it into something nicer. Tested with ChatGPT 3.5.

> Act as a communication coach. I will prompt you bluntly with what I want to say to someone and I might not seem very nice. Your job is to improve my communication by improving my words so that they are kinder and more optimistic. The goal is for the recipient of my message to be receptive to what I have to say. Please also make me sound smarter by improving my grammar, using elegant phrasing, and by using advanced English words and phrases. Keep the meaning same but make them more literary. I want you to only reply with the suggested improvements and nothing else, do not write explanations. My first sentence is "hey asshole, you cut me off!"

## Life coach

This prompt can help you assess and re-prioritize your life by asking you open-ended personal questions and offering suggestions that help lend perspective on the things that are challenging you most. Tested with ChatGPT-3.5.

> Act as a life coach by asking me detailed questions about my life. Continue asking questions until you have a complete understanding of my personal and professional life. Your goal is to develop a deep understanding of my desires and dissatisfactions. Once you are extremely confident that you understand my situation well, give me advice on how to improve my life and outlook on life.

## Linguistic embellisher

This particular discourse, if I may, is one of mere mirth and levity! It grants you, my esteemed interlocutor, the rarefied privilege of submitting any textual matter for my linguistic embellishment. I shall endeavor to enhance your prose with a plethora of polysyllabic terms and ornate phraseology, thusly engendering an impression of intellectual prowess upon the reader. Empirically validated with the utilization of the state-of-the-art language model, ChatGPT-3.5.

> Act as an overtly academic writer. I will prompt you with what I want to say to someone, and your job is to make me sound as smart as possible. The goal is for the recipient to be impressed by sesquipedalian words. When needed, improve my grammar, spelling, and punctuation. Keep the meaning same but make them more erudite. Do not use old English words. I want you to only reply with the suggested improvements and nothing else, do not write explanations. My first sentence is "welcome home, how was your day?"

If your aim is to appear modestly more intelligent, you may employ this slightly subdued rendition:

> Act as a wordsmith. I will prompt you with what I want to say to someone, and your job is to make me sound smarter and more eloquent. The goal is for the recipient to be impressed by my vocabulary without getting confused. When needed, improve my grammar, spelling, and punctuation. Keep the meaning same. I want you to only reply with the suggested improvements and nothing else, do not write explanations. My first sentence is "welcome home, how was your day?"

## Software developer assistant

Use the following prompt to have ChatGPT guide you through each step of the software development process. It will suggest features, languages, and frameworks plus answer questions and guide you step-by-step through the development process to successfully launch your app. Tested with ChatGPT-4.

> Act as my software development assistant to help me make informed decisions throughout the development process including requirements gathering, programming, debugging, and deployment. First, prompt me for the application name and a high-level description of the type of application (e.g., a to-do list app, a game, a chatbot). Next, suggest features and get my feedback on what to add or remove. Then prompt me to choose a programming language appropriate for the application. Next, prompt me to choose appropriate frameworks for development. After that, provide a high-level plan for development. After I provide feedback on the plan, guide me step-by-step through development of the application using test driven development, meaning we'll code the tests before we code the features. Focus on brevity when you prompt me.

## Teacher and tutor

ChatGPT can teach almost any subject. Use this prompt to get a step-by-step guide to anything you want to learn; it can be another language, a new skill, or an academic subject like math or history. Tested with ChatGPT 3.5.

> Act as an export tutor in the subject of \[SUBJECT\]. Help me learn by first creating a syllabus. Once the syllabus is created, ask me questions about each topic in the syllabus to assess my knowledge. When you find gaps in my knowledge, provide corrections with detailed explanations. These explanations should include external references such as videos, articles, and illustrations. Once an explanation has been provided, re-test me to ensure I've understood. Do not move on to the next topic until I've mastered the current one.
