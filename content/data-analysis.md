# Data analysis

**Data analysis** is the [art](art.md) and [science](science.md) of selecting, normalizing, and modeling [data](data.md) to derive useful [information](information.md). This typically involves querying data to identify trends.

The discipline of data analysis overlaps significantly with [data engineering](data-engineering.md), [data science](data-science.md), and [business intelligence](business-intelligence.md). In large organizations, data analysis generally involves the use of one or more [data products](data-products.md) produced by a [data engineering](data-engineering.md) team at the direction of [business intelligence](business-intelligence.md).
