# Data analysis

**Data analysis** is the [art](art.md) and [science](science.md) of selecting, normalizing, and modeling [data](data.md) to derive useful [information](information.md), typically for [businesses](business-intelligence.md). This generally involves querying data to identify trends and measure performance.

The discipline of data analysis overlaps significantly with [data engineering](data-engineering.md), [data science](data-science.md), and [business intelligence](business-intelligence.md). However, data analysis focuses on telling stories through data through reports and and [visualizations](data-visualizations.md).
