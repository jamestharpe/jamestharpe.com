# High brand loyalty (HBL) consumers

In [marketing](marketing.md), **high brand loyalty (HBL) consumers** are customers that repeatedly purchases products or services from a particular brand, despite competing options in the market. HBL consumers are often highly satisfied and emotionally attached to the brand, and may feel a strong sense of identification with it. HBL consumers are therefore less likely to switch to brands, even if in the face of lower prices or other incentives. They may also be more likely to recommend the brand to others and to defend it against criticism.

For businesses, high brand loyalty consumers are valuable because they provide a reliable source of revenue and can help to generate positive word-of-mouth advertising. However, businesses must also work to maintain high levels of customer satisfaction and continue to provide high-quality products or services in order to retain these customers.

Examples of brands that cultivate HBL consumers:

**Apple** is known for its customers' willingness to pay a premium for its products and to upgrade to new models almost as soon as they are released.

**Nike** has a strong, athlete-oriented brand identity and reputation for quality, style, and innovation in the world of sports. Customers that are loyal to the Nike brand often consider it part of their lifestyle.

**Coca-Cola** is known for its customers having a strong attachment to the brand, particularly in the American South where Coke was first invented.

**Harley-Davidson** is known for its loyal following of motorcycle enthusiast who make the brand's rugged, rebellious image part of their lifestyle.
