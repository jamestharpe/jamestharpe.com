# Mechanical Engineering

**Mechanical engineering** is the practical application of the fundamental forces of [physics](physics.md) - motion, energy, force - to create machines. **Machines** are physical structures that use [power](power.md) to apply force to control movement to perform an intended action.

## Mechanical Engineering Terminology

| Term                | Definition                                                                                    |
| ------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Mechanism           | A machine that transforms direction and force                                                 |
| Stress              | The amount of reactive force per unit area; a force that works in opposition to another force |
| [Torque](torque.md) | Force that causes an object to rotate around an axis                                          |
