# Conductance and Siemens

**Conductance** ($G$) is the ability of a material to carry electricity, is [measured](si-units.md) in Siemens ($S$), and defined indirectly by [Ohm's Law](ohms-law.md) as [current](current.md) ($I$) over [voltage](voltage.md), or $G = I/V$. The inverse of conductance is [resistance](resistance.md).

**Conductors** are materials that carry electricity well, and thus have a high conductance (and thus a low resistance) value.
