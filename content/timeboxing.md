# Timeboxing

A **timebox** is a fixed amount of time dedicated exclusively to a particular goal. At the end of that time, the work is evaluated even if it's incomplete. The idea is to create focus on the goal by eliminating other goals from focus that may be important, but can also create distraction. The timebox ends with a "hard stop" to provide an opportunity to assess the progress and decide what to do next. 

At the end of a timebox, the options generally are:

* Keep going
* Keep going, but change something first
* Do something else

The basic structure of a timebox is to:

1. Decide on the goal and set aside a fixed amount of time
2. Work toward the goal for the fixed amount of time
3. Stop work and evaluate what to do next
