# Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment (CI/CD)

CI/CD is the combined set of Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment practices.

## What is Continuous Integration?

Continuous Integration is a set of processes and practices designed to improve development time and quality by continuously merging all developer work into a shared main line of development and ensuring these changes all work together as intended through automation.

## What is Continuous Deployment

Continuous Deployment is the process of improving time-to-value by continuously deploying and monitoring code, ideally all the way through to production.
