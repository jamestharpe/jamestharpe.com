# Five Whys

Five Whys is a heuristic approach for root-cause analysis. When faced with an opportunity, asking why five times can prove useful to identify underlying causes and motivations. The _five_ in "five whys" is anecdotally the number of iterations required to get to the real root cause, however more or fewer may be required in reality.

## Example: Underlying Motivations

**Opportunity:** I want a promotion

1. **Why do you want a promotion?** To increase my income and influence.
1. **Why do you want to increase your influence?** To build & be part of a culture that I will find fulfilling.
1. **Why build a culture?** I'm going to be here for a long time.
1. **Why will you be here for a long time?** I'm motivated to influence the culture because believe I can find a balance between my need to take risks and my need for financial security.
1. **Why do you need to balance risk and security?** Family makes risk too scary without security, but I get bored without risk and start to fail. To feel successful, I need to take risks that pay off but realistically I need security to take those risks.
