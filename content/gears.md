# Gears

**Gears** are toothed wheels that, when combined in different configurations, can change the speed, direction, and/or [torque](torque.md) of a power source.

Gear sizes are typically expressed by number of teeth, circumference, diameter, or radius. Gears can be used to create [mechanical advantage](mechanical-advantage.md) equal to the ratio of the driver gear over the driven gear; this ratio is also referred to as the **gear ratio**.

## Gear Terminology

| Part         | Definition                                                                              |
| ------------ | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Axis         | Where the shaft passes through                                                          |
| Cog          | A tooth on a wheel                                                                      |
| Cylinder     | The "wheel" portion of the gear                                                         |
| Driver Gear  | A gear rotated by a power source                                                        |
| Driven Gear  | A gear rotated by a driver gear                                                         |
| Gear ratio   | The ratio of the sizes of two gears, typically the driver gear over the driven gear     |
| Gear train   | The combination of two or more gears                                                    |
| Pitch Circle | The circumference the the gear, measured at the point of force between two meshed gears |
| Tooth        | The lever protruding from the cylinder or cone                                          |
