# Types of machine learning

<!-- TODO:

Clustering - Group objects together based on similarities in data. For example, identifying marketing segments based on customer demographics.

Anomaly detection - Find observations that are different than the "normal" data. e.g. a spike in negative social media comments after a new product release

Association learning - ...

Numeric estimation - ...

-----
