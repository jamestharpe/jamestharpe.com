# International System of Units (SI)

**SI Units** are the formal terms, definitions, and symbols used in the metric system. SI units start from **base units** which are the axiomatic building blocks from which all other units, called **derived units**, are created.

Base units include standard measures for time (second), distance (meter), mass (kilogram), pressure (bar), and more. Derived units combine base units, for example velocity ($v$) is distance ($d$) over time ($t$), or $v=d/t$.

## SI Unit Prefixes

| giga   | $G$    | $10^{9}$  |
| mega   | $M$    | $10^{6}$  |
| kilo   | $k$    | $10^{3}$  |
| hecto  | $h$    | $10^{2}$  |
| deca   | $h$    | $10^{1}$  |
| deci   | $d$    | $10^{-1}$ |
| centi  | $d$    | $10^{-2}$ |
| milli  | $m$    | $10^{-3}$ |
