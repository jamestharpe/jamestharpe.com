## Relay

A **relay** is a switch that can be [electronically](electrical-engineering.md) controlled to open or close a circuit.

Generally speaking, relays consist of an electromagnet, a [mechanically movable](mechanical-engineering.md) contact, switching points, and a spring. An electrical signal is then used to activate the electromagnet which opens or closes the circuit; when the signal is turned off the electromagnet deactivates and the spring returns the circuit to its original position.
