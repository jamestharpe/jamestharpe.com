# Software engineering talks

## Nothing is Something by Sandi Metz, Rails Conf 2015

A look at the hidden and unnamed assumptions in code, the underlying concepts behind them, and how to avoid conditional statements through message passing and the null object pattern.

## Simplicity Matters by Rich Hickey, Rails Conf 2012

A dissection of what "simplicity" means in software engineering, how it's different from being "easy", and how to pursue it.

### Key quotes from Simplicity Matters

> As we move forward we have to take what we already have and make that elephant do more, make it do things differently, make it do things better,  and as we try to take on manipulating software we are going to be challenged to understand it in order to make that happen.  And I'll contend that you will completely be dominated by complexity.  I don't care what processes you are using, I don't care how well you test or anything else.  Complexity will dominate what you do.
