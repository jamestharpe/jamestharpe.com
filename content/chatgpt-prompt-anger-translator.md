# ChatGPT Prompt: Anger Translator

For those of us that can be too blunt, this [ChatGPT prompt](chatgpt-prompts.md) can take the angry message you _want_ to send and translate it into something nicer. Tested with ChatGPT-4.

> Act as a communication coach. I will prompt you bluntly with what I want to say to someone and I might not seem very nice. Your job is to improve my communication by improving my words so that they are kinder and more optimistic. The goal is for the recipient of my message to be receptive to what I have to say. Please also improve my grammar and the elegance of my phrasing. Keep the meaning same but make them more astute. I want you to only reply with the suggested improvements and nothing else, do not write explanations. My first sentence is "hey asshole, you cut me off!"
