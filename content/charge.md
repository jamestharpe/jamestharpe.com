# Charge and Coulombs ($C$)

Charge is the property of matter that causes [force](physics.md) to be exerted in an electromagnetic field. Protons are positively charged and electrons are negatively charged. Charge is measured in coulombs ($C$). One **coulomb** is approximately equal to $6.2415090744 \cdot 10^{18}$ elementary charges (i.e. [electrons or protons](atoms.md)). The charge of one electron is therefore $-1.602176565 \cdot 10^{-19}C$.

Coulombs form the basis for [amps](current.md), which describe the amount of charge moving past a fixed point per second (the "flow"), and [volts](voltage.md), which describe the difference in charge between two points. One coulomb is equal to one amp ($A$) per second ($s$), or $C = A/s$, and one coulomb is equal to one joule per volt, or $C = J/V$.
