# Fundamental Terms of Physics

**Energy** is the ability to do work. **Work** is the energy transferred to an object that causes a displacement. A **displacement** is the measure of the distance moved in a specific direction, or the shortest distance from an initial to a final position.

Work is most commonly measured in joules ($J$). One **joule** is equal to the energy required for one newton ($N$) to perform a displacement of one meter ($m$), or $J=Nm$.

Newtons are a measurement of force. One **newton** is the force required to accelerate one kilogram ($kg$) one meter per second squared, or $N = \frac{kg*m}{s^2}$.
