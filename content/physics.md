# Fundamental Terms of Physics

**Energy** is the ability to do work. **Work** is the energy transferred to an object that causes a displacement. A **displacement** is the measure of the distance moved in a specific direction, or the shortest distance from an initial to a final position.

![Distance vs. Displacement](/img/distance-vs-displacement.svg)

Work is most commonly measured in joules ($J$). One **joule** is equal to the energy required for one newton ($N$) to perform a displacement of one meter ($m$), or $J=Nm$.

Newtons are a measurement of force. One **newton** is the force required to accelerate one kilogram ($kg$) one meter per second squared, or $N = \frac{kg*m}{s^2}$.

## Kinetic and Potential Energy

* **Kinetic energy** is the energy an object possesses by being in motion (moving)
* **Potential energy** is the energy an object has by being at rest (not moving)

### Gravitational Potential Energy

**Gravitational Potential Energy** is the energy an object has by being at some height and would be converted to kinetic energy when the object is dropped. The force of Gravity on Earth ($G$) is constant at $9.8m/s^2$, therefore to calculate the gravitational energy of an object, we can use $G$ as the value for force, the object's height ($H$) as the distance, and the objects mass ($M$) for the mass, or: $J=MGH$.

## Power

**Power** ($P$) is amount of work (energy transfer), measured in watts. One **watt** is equal to 1 joule per second, or $W=J/s$. Power can therefore be thought of as "energy per time".
