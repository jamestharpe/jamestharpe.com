# Semisupervised machine learning

**Semisupervised machine learning** is a type of [machine learning](machine-learning.md) that combines [supervised](ml-supervised.md) and [unsupervised](ml-unsupervised.md) techniques. For example, a photo hosting service may use unsupervised learning to recognize an individual present in multiple photographs (using clustering), then prompt the user for that individuals name to apply the label (the person's name) to the cluster (the set of photos in which the person appears).
