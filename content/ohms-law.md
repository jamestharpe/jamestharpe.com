# Ohm's Law

**Ohm's Law** describes the relationship between [current](electricity.md) ($I$), [voltage](electricity.md) ($V$), and resistance ($R$):

$I = V/R$

Given tha values for any two variables, we solve for the third, so that:

$V = IR$

And:

$R = V/I$

Resistance is how much the flow of electricity is impeded, measured in ohms ($Î©$).
