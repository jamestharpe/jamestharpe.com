# Ohm's Law

**Ohm's Law** describes the relationship between [current](current.md) ($I$), [voltage](voltage.md) ($V$), and [resistance](resistance.md) ($R$), so that **current**, which is the flow of [electricity](electricity.md), is defined as:

$I = V/R$

Given the values for any two variables, we solve for the third, so that **voltage**, electrical potential energy, is defined as:

$V = IR$

And [**resistance**](resistance.md), which impedes the flow of electricity, is:

$R = V/I$

[**Conductance**](conductance.md) ($G$), which is the ability for a material to conduct electricity is defined as the inverse of resistance, and can therefore calculated by Ohm's Law as:

$G = I/V$

## History

Ohm's Law is named after [Georg Simon Ohm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Georg_Ohm), who first derived the relationships now known as Ohm's Law.
