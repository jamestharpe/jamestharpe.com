# Ohm's Law

$I = V/R$, or $V = IR$, or $R = V/I$ 

Where $I = current$, $V = Voltage$, and $R = Resistance$.

## Current ($I$)

$I = V/R$

Current ($I$) is the "flow" of electricity, measured in amperes ($A$ or "amps"). One amp ($1A$) is equal to one coulomb ($C$, or sometimes $Q$) passing a given point in a circuit over one second ($s$), or $1A = 1C / 1s$ or, solving for $C$, $1C = 1A * 1s$. A coulomb is approximately $6.2415090744 * 10^{18}$ elementary charges.

## Voltage ($V$)

$V = IR$

Voltage $V$ is the difference in electric potential energy between two points, measured in volts. One volt is equal to 1 joule ($J$) per 1 coulomb ($C$), or $1V = 1J/1C$. A Joule ($J$) is the work required to move (displace) an electric charge of one coulomb through an electrical potential difference of one volt, or $1V * 1C = 1J$. Work is the energy transferred to an object that causes it to move (or, more technically, that causes a displacement).

## Resistance ($R$)

$R = V/I$ 

Resistance is how much a charge is impeded, measured in ohms ($Î©$).
