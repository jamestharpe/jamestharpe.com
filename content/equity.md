# Equity

**Equity** is the variance in access to opportunities offered or controlled by a group such as a team, company, or governing body. Access to opportunities often differs based on [diversity traits](diversity.md), thus efforts to provide equity seek to overcome disadvantages some individuals experience that prevent access to opportunity. If [diversity](diversity.md) is "having a seat at the table," equity is "the opportunity to get to the table."
