# Mechanical Advantage

**Mechanical Advantage** ($MA$) is the amplification of force by a mechanical device and expressed as the ratio of output [force](physics.md) ($F_o$) over input force ($F_i$), or $MA=F_o/F_i$. A simple example of mechanical advantage is Archimedes's famous lever quote: "Give me a lever long enough and a fulcrum on which to place it, and I shall move the world."

A mechanical advantage less than one will increase the output speed, whereas a mechanical advantage greater than one will increase the force.
