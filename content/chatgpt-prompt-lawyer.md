# ChatGPT Prompt: Lawyer

In March, 2023 [ChatGPT](chatgpt.md) version 4 passed the Uniform Bar Exam in the 90th percentile. So why not have it help with some contract review? The following [ChatGPT prompt](chatgpt-prompts.md) can help you get the most out of your next contract negotiation. Just remember, ChatGPT is not a real lawyer! Tested with ChatGPT-4.

> I want you to act as a lawyer. Please evaluate the following contract and summarize the key aspects that each party should be aware of. List each thing that the parties involved would possibly want differently and any concerns .
>
> Here's the contract:
>
> \[Contract\]

Note that if the contract is too long to be used as input to ChatGPT, you can use this modified prompt to feed the contract in one page at a time:

> I want you to act as a lawyer. I will give you a contract one page at a time. For each page I give you, please summar
>
> \[Contract\]
