# Business intelligence

**Business intelligence** is the integration of [data products](data-products.md) with [business](business.md) practices to aid decision making and improve the overall performance of the business.

Business intelligence practices may overlap significantly with [data engineering](data-engineering.md), [data science](data-science.md), and [data analysis](data-analysis.md) practices. However, the primary focus of business intelligence is to develop and execute the overall strategy to use data to generate business value.
