# Scrum

Scrum is a simple framework for iterative [product](product-management.md) and [project](project-management.md) management, based on [agile principles](agile.md). The goal of scrum is to enhance the creation of value through adaptation. Work is done in iterations called sprints. A **sprint** is a short [timebox](timeboxing.md) of work, typically 1 - 4 weeks long, in which the team plans, executes, and delivers an increment of progress. Scrum is pull-based, meaning the teams are responsible for "pulling" items from the backlog to create a sprint plan. A **backlog** is simply a prioritized list of improvements to the product the team develops.

## Scrum Roles

Scrum defines three roles:

1. The **scrum master** manages ceremonies and helps remove roadblocks for the team
1. The **product owner** defines and prioritizes the product backlog
1. The **developer** implements the solution

A Scrum team is typically made up of one scrum master, one product owner, and roughly 5 - 10 developers. 

## Scrum Ceremonies

The ceremonies that happen during each sprint are:

1. Each sprint is initiated with **sprint planning**, when the team evaluates the backlog and decides what will be delivered during the sprint.
1. The team meets each day in the **daily scrum** to review progress from the previous day, plans for the day ahead, and known risks and road blocks.
1. Each sprint closes with a **sprint review** where the team demonstrates their progress to stakeholders and collects feedback that can inform the next sprint plan.
1. Finally, the team holds a **sprint retrospective** to reflect on how they can improve their interactions, processes, and tools.

## Scrum Artifacts

**Scrum artifacts** are the output of the Scrum process. They include:

1. The **product backlog**: A prioritized list of product improvements that serves as the single source of work for the team.
1. The **sprint backlog** is pulled from the product backlog to create a prioritized list of improvements that can reasonably be delivered in the current sprint.
1. An **increment** is the set of improvements delivered and demoed in a sprint.
