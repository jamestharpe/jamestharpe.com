# Backlog coupling

**Backlog coupling** is when work defined in one [product backlog](product-management.md) depends on work from one or more other product backlogs to be completed before the work can be completed. While some coupling is inevitable, _excessive_ coupling between backlogs causes productivity and responsiveness to suffer and usually indicates a team topology or architectural problem. When unaddressed, backlog coupling damages a team's ability to account for outcomes, and ultimatly erodes motivation and leads to apathy because it becomes easy to shift blame and give up on ideas to improve.
