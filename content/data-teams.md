# Data Teams

**Data teams** are teams, or teams of teams, that combine [data engineering](data-engineering.md), [data science](data-science.md), [data analysis](data-analysis.md), [business intelligence](business-intelligence.md), and other [data](data.md)-related disciplines to improve decision making.

## Differences and interactions between data discipline

Disciplines related to data have significant overlap in roles and skills, but each has a distinct focus. The [needs](requirements.md) of the business are driven and validated by business intelligence. Data engineering provide the automation and infrastructure to collect, transform, and [pipe](data-pipelines.md) data to data analysts and data scientists. Data analysts query data to identify trends, create [visualizations](data-visualizations.md), and build reports while data scientists build machine learning and statistical models.

Depending on the company size and data needs, a single person may be responsible for multiple disciplines or entire teams may form around a single discipline.
