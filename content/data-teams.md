# Data Teams

**Data teams** are teams, or teams of teams, that combine [data engineering](data-engineering.md), [data science](data-science.md), [data analysis](data-analysis.md), [business intelligence](business-intelligence.md), and other [data](data.md)-related disciplines to improve decision making. Teams may form around a discipline to provide a shared service, or may form cross-functionally to serve a specific product or service end-to-end.

## Differences and interactions between data discipline

Disciplines related to data have significant overlap in roles and skills, but each has a distinct focus. The [needs](requirements.md) of the business are driven and validated by business intelligence. Data engineering provide the automation and infrastructure to collect, transform, and [pipe](data-pipelines.md) data to data analysts and data scientists. Data analysts query data to identify trends, create [visualizations](data-visualizations.md), and build reports and dashboards while data scientists build machine learning and statistical models.

Whether a data team is formed around a specific discipline or as a cross-functional team, each team needs to meet a set of minimal skills to work effectively. The table below matches each discipline and skill to a minimum [level of proficiency](dreyfus-model-of-skill-acquisition.md) suitable for most contexts where a data team is required.

- Novice: Little or no knowledge required
- Beginner: Knows the basics but requires help to apply successfully
- Competent: Able to perform most tasks adequately without significant help
- Proficient: Able to design, plan, build and coach others on advanced applications

## Nontechnical needs of data teams

* Deep understanding of the business they're modeling
* Ability to simplify complex analyses

## Signs of effective data teams

- "It's all just data" - The organization takes the hard work of the data engineering teams for granted. As a consumer of data, it just seems so easy.
- Data is generally trusted and correctly interpreted, thanks to effective communication
