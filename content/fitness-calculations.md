# Fitness calculations

**Fitness calculations** help estimate, assess, and plan to improve ones overall [physical fitness](physical-fitness.md).

### Body fat percentage (BFP) and Lean mass percentage (LMP)

**Body fat percentage (BFP)** is one's total fat mass ($f$) divided by total body mass ($m$), or $BFP = f/m$. Conversely, **lean mass percentage (LMP)** is one's total lean mass ($l$) divided by total body mass, or $LMP = l/m$. An easy way to calculate either value is to subtract the other value from $1$. Thus, $LMP = 1-BFP$ and $BFP = 1 - LFP$.

The most common way to determine BFP (and, by extension, LMP) is bioelectrical impedance because it is supported by many consumer products such as bathroom scales, smart watches, and other consumer health devices.
