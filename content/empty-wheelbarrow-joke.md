# The empty wheelbarrow (joke)

At a busy construction site that had fallen behind schedule, a worker was found running around with an empty wheelbarrow. The foreman stopped the worker to ask, "why are you running around with an empty wheelbarrow?"

The worker replied, "we're in a rush, there's no time to load it!"
