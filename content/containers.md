# Containers

Containers are a way of packaging applications with their dependencies and configuration in a single, runnable package. Containers are similar to virtual machines in that they isolate applications from each other on a shared [operating system](operating-systems.md) but different in that containers do not provide hardware-level virtualization as virtual machines do.
