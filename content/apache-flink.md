# Apache Flink

**Apache Flink** is an [open-source software](open-source-software.md) engine and framework from [Apache](apache.md) for performing stateful computations on [data](data.md) streams. It supports continuous processing of **unbounded streams**, which are data streams with a defined start by no defined end, as well as **bounded streams**, which have both a defined start and end.
