## Existential Links

* **[The Death Clock](https://www.death-clock.org/)** estimates how long you have to live and provides a count-down
* **[How many keys do you have left?](https://www.keysleft.com/)** approximates how many more words you have time to type in your remaining lifetime, then equates that to the number of books, tweets, letters, and other texts you could write.
