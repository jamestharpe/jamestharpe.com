# User Experience (UX)

**User Experience (UX)** is a critical field in [product development](product-management.md) that focuses on enhancing a user's satisfaction and ability to interact with a product, system, or service. UX is a holistic discipline that considers all aspects of the user's interaction, including usability, accessibility, performance, design/aesthetics, utility, ergonomics, overall human interaction, and marketing. The discipline of UX requires the development of a deep understanding of users, as well as business goals and objectives, to ensure the design of a successful solution.
