# K-nearest neighbors (KNN) classification algorithm

The **k-nearest neighbors (KNN or K-NN)** classification algorithm is a [classification algorithm](ml-supervised-classification-learning.md) used in [supervised machine learning](ml-supervised.md) that predicts a given input's classification based on its proximity to data points from the training dataset using a simple majority, with the `k` represents the number of data points to compare.
