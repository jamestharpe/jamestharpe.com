# Conway's Law

> Any organization that designs a system will produce a design whose structure is a copy of the organization's communication structure.

In other words, the way software is [architected](software-architecture.md) will tend to reflect the communication of the organization that built it. Pain points perceived as limitations of software are often therefore solved through organizational changes. Thus, an **inverse conway maneuver** is the architectural "trick" of achieving an architectural goal through the encouragement of structural changes to how the organization communicates.
