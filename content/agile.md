# Agile

**Agile** is a set of four values based on 12 principles intended to create better software [products](product-management.md) through people-centric [projects management](project-management.md).

## The Agile Manifesto

> ### Manifesto for Agile Software Development
>
> We are uncovering better ways of developing software by doing it and helping others do it. Through this work we have come to value:
>
> * Individuals and interactions over processes and tools
> * Working software over comprehensive documentation
> * Customer collaboration over contract negotiation
> * Responding to change over following a plan
>
> That is, while there is value in the items on the right, we value the items on the left more.

## Agile principles

> ### Principles behind the Agile Manifesto

> We follow these principles:
>
> Our highest priority is to satisfy the customer through early and continuous delivery of valuable software.
>
> Welcome changing requirements, even late in development. Agile processes harness change for the customer's competitive advantage.
>
> Deliver working software frequently, from a couple of weeks to a couple of months, with a preference to the shorter timescale.
>
> Business people and developers must work together daily throughout the project.
>
> Build projects around motivated individuals. Give them the environment and support they need, and trust them to get the job done.
>
> The most efficient and effective method of conveying information to and within a development team is face-to-face conversation.
>
> Working software is the primary measure of progress.
>
> Agile processes promote sustainable development. The sponsors, developers, and users should be able to maintain a constant pace indefinitely.
>
> Continuous attention to technical excellence and good design enhances agility.
>
> Simplicity--the art of maximizing the amount of work not done--is essential.
>
> The best architectures, requirements, and designs emerge from self-organizing teams.
>
> At regular intervals, the team reflects on how to become more effective, then tunes and adjusts its behavior accordingly.
