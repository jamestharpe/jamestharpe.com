# Coulombs

Coulombs ($C$) are the [SI Unit](si-units.md) of electrical charge, approximately equal to $6.2415090744 \cdot 10^{18}$ elementary charges (i.e. electrons or protons) and form the basis for [amps](current.md) and [volts](voltage.md) in that one coulomb is equal to one amp ($A$) per second ($s$), or $C = A/s$, and one coulomb is equal to one joule per volt, or $C = J/V$.
