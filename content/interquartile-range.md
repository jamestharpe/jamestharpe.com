# Interquartile Range (IQR)

The interquartile range, or IQR, is the middle half of a collection of numbers when ordered from lowest to highest.

To find the interquartile range of a collection:

1. Find the [median](median.md) of the collection
2. Find the median of lower and upper half of the collection, leaving out the median number(s)
3. Subtract the lower half's median from the upper half's median. The difference is the $IQR$
