# Angular (TypeScript Framework)

[Angular](https://angular.io/) is an application design framework for building [web](web-dev.md), mobile, and desktop applications with [TypeScript](typescript.md). It's most popular use is to develop web applications.

## Angular Concepts

Angular applications are made up primarily of components, services, and modules that, when assembled, form the application.

### Components

Angular **components** are the visual building blocks of an Angular application, made up of an HTML template, a TypeScript class, and an optional stylesheet.

| Part             | Purpose                                                          |
| ---------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------- |
| HTML Template    | Defines visual elements                                          |
| TypeScript class | Define behaviors                                                 |
| Stylesheet       | Defines how visual elements from the HTML template are displayed |

<!-- TODO 
#### Templates

#### [Pipes](https://angular.io/guide/pipes)

Angular **pipes** transform data for display. Pipes are defined as classes with the [pipe decorator](https://angular.io/api/core/Pipe) and used in templates.

#### Nested Components

### Services

Angular **services** are designed to hold data and business logic.

### Modules

Angular **modules** are groups of related components and services. They can import required components and services, or export them to be consumed by other applications or modules.
