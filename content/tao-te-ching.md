# Tao Te Ching


## Translator's Notes

For this translation, I chose the term "cosmos" to refer to, as [Carl Sagan](carl-sagan.md) put it, "all that is or was or ever will be."

				The tao that can be spoken of is not the tao. 
				Experiences cannot be understood by their names.
			</p>
		</td>
		<td>
			<p>
				"Tao" is only a word. Though the tao is eternal, words are only descriptions. As Thich Nhat Hanh said, "...the teaching is merely a vehicle to describe the truth. Don't mistake it for the truth itself. A finger pointing at the moon is not the moon. The finger is needed to know where to look for the moon, but if you mistake the finger for the moon itself, you will never know the real moon."

				The cosmos exists even when it is not percieved and therefore cannot be named. 
				Names are the origin of all particular things.
			</p>

			<p>
				The cosmos existed before it was ever percieved, conceptualized, or named. 
				Over time we've continuously reconceptualized the cosmos though it remains unchanged.

				Observation without desire reveals the essence of truth. 
				With desire, only the apparent is observed.

				New knowledge requires dispassionate observation. 
				When observed for the sake of our own motivations, we can only understand in terms of what we already know.

				What is true and what is apparent share the same source, but go by different names.

				The truth and our perception of it, no matter how different they may be, come from the same source.

			<p>
				This unity is the mystery of mysteries, the source of all wonders.

			<p>
				The difference between what is true and what we perceive to be true is the ultimate mystery. The motivation to understand and the requirement for dispassionate observation is the ultimate dilemma.

				In this way, being and non-being create each other.
				Difficult and easy complement each other.
				Long and short shape each other.
				High and low support each other.
				Before and after depend on each other.

		<td>Any duality is part of a whole and cannot exist without it. Though we may imagine abstractions like soft and hard or fast and slow independently of each other, they are aspects of the same experience.</td>

		<td>
			<p>
				Therefore the sages act without effort and teach without speaking.
				The sages watch things come and go, without posessing them;
				act without presuming the outcome.
				The sages forget their success, thus success never goes away.
			</p>
		</td>
		<td>
			<p>
				This duality implies that lessons and actions, gains and losses, successes and failures are all part of the same experience and should be treated as such as illustrated in the [Taoist Maybe Story](maybe-story.md).
