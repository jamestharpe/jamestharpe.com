# Requirements

**Requirements** abstractly describe what a solution must and must not do and are the fundamental building blocks of [product](product-management.md) [engineering](engineering.md). In addition to these abstract descriptions, an effective requirements document will contain enough context to explain the rationale behind the individual requirements.

## Marketing vs. engineering Requirements

Requirements come in two broad forms: marketing requirements and engineering requirements. **Marketing requirements** describe the needs and desires of the market served by the product. **Engineering requirements** are derived from marketing requirements and abstractly describe in unambiguous (typically numerical) terms how the product must function to meet the marketing requirements.

For example, the marketing requirement for a camera might be: "The photo quality must be industry leading". A corresponding engineering requirement might then be: "Photos produced must be greater than 8.5 megapixels".

## Elements of well-formed requirements

**Abstract**: Well-formed requirements abstractly describe what the solution must and must not do, without describing how the solution is achieved.

**Verifiable**: Well-formed requirements can be independently and precisely verified and are therefore typically described in numerical terms.

**Traceable**: Well-formed requirements can be traced back to the specific need being solved. Marketing requirements should be traceable to research, whereas engineering requirements should be traceable to the marketing requirements.

**Realistic**: Well-formed requirements can realistically be implemented by the team that will create the solution.

## Constraints

**Constraints** are design decisions that are imposed by the environment in which the solution is being developed or delivered to and typically violate.
