# Flexbox (Flexible Box)

**Flexbox**, a portmanteau of "flexible box", is [CSS](css.md) module to dynamically arrange items of variable size in a container. Flexbox is especially useful to accommodate multiple screen sizes because the container has the ability to alter the width and height of the items it contains to fill the available space efficiently.

Flexbox containers are called **flex containers** and items within flex containers are called **flex items**.
