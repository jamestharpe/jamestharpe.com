# C++

**C++** is a general-purpose, object-oriented, and strongly typed [programming language](computer-languages.md) that emphasizes power and performance. C++ is defined by the [JTC1/SC22/WG21 committee](http://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg21/) (or simply WG21) and [implemented by multiple companies](https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/compiler_support), most of which have membership WG21.

## Hello World in C++

int main()
{
    std::cout << "Hello World!" << std::endl;
}
