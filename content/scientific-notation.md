# Scientific Notation

**Scientific Notation** is a way to express very small and very large numbers using exponents, and is useful for brevity and for comparing orders of magnitude between numbers.

To convert a number to scientific notation, it is rewritten to be greater than zero but less than ten multiplied by $10$ raised to some exponent.

Simple Examples:

* $99,000$ expressed in scientific notation is $9.9 \cdot 10^4$. 
* $0.00099$ expressed in scientific notation is $9.9 \cdot 10^{-4}$

[SI number prefixes](si-units.md) are commonly used in lieu of scientific or [engineering notation](engineering-notation.md). For example, rather than writing "$1.23 \cdot 10^3g$" (grams), we can write "$1.23kg$" (kilograms).

## Common large numbers expressed in scientific notation

* **Avogadro's number** is $6.02214076 \cdot 10^{23}$.
* The charge of an Electron is $0.6021766208*10^{-19}$ [coulombs](voltage.md).
* A **googol** is, a one followed by 100 zeros, is $1 \cdot 10^{100}$
* The **speed of light** is $2.99792458 \cdot 10^8$ meters per second.
