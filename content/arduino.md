# Arduino

**Arduino** is a set of [ope-source hardware](open-source-hardware.md) and [software](open-source-software.md) used to build interactive electronics projects. Applications for Arduino are typically written in [C++](cpp.md) in the [Arduino IDE](https://www.arduino.cc/en/software) or [Arduino Cloud Editor](https://docs.arduino.cc/learn/starting-guide/the-arduino-web-editor/) (recommended over Arduino IDE); however other options for controlling arduinos exist such as with [Node-RED](https://nodered.org/docs/faq/interacting-with-arduino).

## Components of an Arduino Build

1. **Sensors** convert physical phenomena into [electrical signals](electrical-engineering.md) (e.g. humidity, light, proximity)
2. **Effectors** convert electrical signals into physical phenomena (e.g. lights, motors, solenoids)
3. **Code** processes inputs from sensors and controls the outputs to effectors to create desired behaviors
4. **Wires** carry [electrical power](watts-law.md) and signals between components
