# Open-source

 **Open source** refers to anything that people can modify and share because its design is publicly accessible. This concept can broadly be divided into [software](open-source-software.md) and [hardware](open-source-hardware.md). Designs can include [source code](computer-languages.md), blueprints, schematics, and more.
