# Responsible, Accountable, Consulted, Informed (RACI)

**RACI** is a model to clearly articulate the roles and responsibilities for a person, team, organization, or activity. The term "RACI" is derived from the model, which specifies who is responsible, accountable, consulted, and informed for a given outcome.

**Responsible** refers to the person that does the work. The RACI model prescribes that this is never more than one person.

**Accountable** refers to the decision maker or decision making body. The accountable person or committee is generally expected to justify (provide an account of) the decisions made.

**Consulted** refers to anyone that can help make an informed decision or evaluate the quality of work, but does not necessarily make the decision or perform the work.

**Informed** refers to anyone that should be notified of decisions and when work is completed.

## RACI Charts

RACI charts help organize and visualize the RACI model by plotting work by attribute or by plotting attribute by.
