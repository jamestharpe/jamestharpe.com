# Electrical Engineering and Electronics

**Electrical engineering** is the practical application of [electricity](electricity.md) to create new tools and devices.

## Terminology

| Term                              | Definition                                                                                                                                                                        |
| --------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Analog-to-Digital Converter (ADC) | A converter that changes an analog signal to a digital signal.                                                                                                                    |
| Baud Rate                         | The number of bits per second that can be sent over a serial connection                                                                                                           |
| [Conductor](conductance.md)       | A material that conducts electricity well because it has weak valence bonds such as copper, gold, silver, aluminum, or even saltwater.                                            |
| Digital Pin                       | A type of pin that can only be in an "on" or "off" state.                                                                                                                         |
| Digital to Analog Converter (DAC) | A converter that changes a digital signal to an analog signal.                                                                                                                    |
| Electrical Contact                | An electrical circuit component that consists of a conductive material (typically metal) that, when touched to another contact, can pass an electrical [current](electricity.md). |
| Electrical Load                   | The portion of a circuit that uses [electrical power](watts-law.md)                                                                                                               |
| Electrical Signal                 | An variation in [voltage or current](ohms-law.md) frequency, phase, or duration used to represent information                                                                  |
| Insulator                         | A material that conducts electricity poorly because it has strong valence bonds such as glass, rubber, plastic, and even air                                                      |
| Pin                               | A type of electrical contact in which the connection is designed to be pressed together (i.e. a plug) to form a reliable, low-[resistance](resistance.md) connection.             |
| Power Supply                      | Av electrical device that supplies [power](watts-law.md) to a circuit                                                                                                             |
| Semiconductor                     | A material that can act like an insulator or conductor, depending on the circumstances such as Silicon                                                                            |
| Serial Port                       | An interface through which an electrical signal is transferred sequentially, one bit at a time                                                                                    |
| Two Wire Interface (TWI)          | A communication protocol consisting of a data line and a clock line.                                                                                                              |

## Conventions

- Red wires are typically used for power and connect to positive terminals
- Black wires are typically used for ground and connect to negative terminals
- Other colors are typically used for electrical signals
