## Terminology

| Term                              | Definition                                                                                                                                                                        |
| --------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Analog-to-Digital Converter (ADC) | A converter that changes an analog signal to a digital signal.                                                                                                                    |
| Digital Pin                       | A type of pin that can only be in an "on" or "off" state.                                                                                                                         |
| Digital to Analog Converter (DAC) | A converter that changes a digital signal to an analog signal.                                                                                                                    |
| Electrical Contact                | An electrical circuit component that consists of a conductive material (typically metal) that, when touched to another contact, can pass an electrical [current](electricity.md). |
| Electrical Load                   | The portion of a circuit that uses [electrical power](watts-law.md)                                                                                                               |
| Electrical Signal                 | An variation in [voltage or current](electricity.md) frequency, phase, or duration used to represent information                                                                  |
| Pin                               | A type of electrical contact in which the connection is designed to be pressed together (i.e. a plug) to form a reliable, low-resistance connection.                              |
| Power Supply                      | Av electrical device that supplies [power](watts-law.md) to a circuit                                                                                                             |
| Two Wire Interface (TWI)          | A communication protocol consisting of a data line and a clock line.                                                                                                              |
