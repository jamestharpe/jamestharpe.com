# Torque

**Torque** ($\tau$) is force that causes an object to rotate around an axis and is measured in joules ($J$). Formally, torque is force ($F$) times distance ($d$), or $\tau=Fd$. Though torque's definition is very similar to [work](physics.md) and the units of measure are the same, it is _not_ work because work by definition causes _displacement_ which is linear whereas torque by definition causes _rotation_.

By convention, Torque is negative when the rotation is clockwise and positive when rotation is counter-clockwise.
