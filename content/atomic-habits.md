# Atomic Habits by [James Clear](https://twitter.com/jamesclear)

**Atomic Habits** argues that small, daily improvements culminate in huge long-term payoffs. Good financial, dietary, and practice habits won't pay off immediately, but will _eventually_ be reflected in your net worth, weight, and skills.

Incremental changes often require patience. Clear uses the example of melting an ice cube frozen at 26°F by heating it to 31°F - the work of heating the ice cube wasn't wasted, it's being stored. The ice cube will suddenly start melting as it passes 32°F. New habits can build up in the same way; exercising for a day, a week, or a month, might not mean hitting your goal weight right away, but once you do hit your goal wait you can maintain it indefinitely if you've built the right habits.

## Key Lessons from Atomic Habits

### Changes in Habits are Changes in Identity

To improve yourself requires changes in beliefs, including beliefs about who you are. Everyone makes mistakes, falters, and indulges in bad habits - the goal is to "win" most of the time by avoiding, and eventually breaking, bad habits and building good ones _most of the time_.

Clear lays out a two-step process for reshaping your identity:

1. Decide the type of person you want to be
1. Prove you are that person with small wins

Goals can be a good place to start. If you have the goal of writing a book, ask "who is the type of person who could write a book?" and allow the answer to shift your focus from the achieving the goal of writing a book, to forming the habits of a writer.

### Steps to Build Good Habits

Habits are acted out in four steps: Cue, craving, response, reward. The cue initiates the habit, which causes a craving. The craving causes the response, which is to seek out the reward and thus satisfies the habit for the time being.

Clear lays out four steps to build new habits that align with how habits are acted out to accelerate:

1. Make it obvious
1. Make it attractive
1. Make it easy
1. Make it satisfying

#### Techniques to Make Habits more Obvious

**Point-and-call:** As you perform a habit, identify it and name it aloud. This brings awareness to your actions and motivations, both good and bad. Clear suggests using a [habit scorecard](https://jamesclear.com/habits-scorecard) as a starting point for this practice.

**Habit stacking:** As you perform a habit that's already well established, use it as a reminder to perform or encourage the new habit you're trying to build. For example: Use your lunch routine to trigger a meditation habit, or use your bed-making habit to encourage your reading habit by placing a book on your pillow to read that evening.

**Manage environmental cues:** It's easy to avoid bad habits, like drinking and smoking, if you don't have the required materials (alcohol and cigarettes). Conversely, it's easier to build good habits, like reading and exercise, if you have the required materials (books and weights) and they're where you can see them.

**One space, one use:** Create separate spaces for things like work, study, eating, exercise, etc. This creates divisions that help maintain focus and set boundaries.

### We are Products of Our Environment

Though we might sometimes overpower temptation, we're ultimately a product of our environment. It is therefore important to cut bad habits off from the source. _Get rid of bad habit triggers, make your good habit triggers obvious._
