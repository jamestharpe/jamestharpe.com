# Data Pipelines

A **data pipeline**, sometimes referred to as an **[ETL](etls.md) pipeline**, is a process that ingests raw [data](data.md) and transforms it to be useful to an organization as [information](information.md) consumable by one or more [data products](data-products.md). Data pipelines may be chained together where the output from one pipeline is passed as input to another.
