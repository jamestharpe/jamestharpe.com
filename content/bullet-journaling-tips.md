# Bullet Journaling Tips

* **Start new custom collections with a mission statement** to stay focused on what's important. [Five whys](five-whys.md) is a great exercise to help get to the root of what _really_ needs to be accomplished. It also helps avoid "junk drawer" collections that ultimately serve no purpose.
* **Don't depend on colors or fancy artwork** lest your system fall apart when you can't find the right color pens or left your stencils in the office.
* **"Word wrap" at two blocks** (when using a dot journal) to prevent words running off of the page and to provide a little extra margin for later addendum/correction.
* **Write-out your schedule each day** to see it at-a-glance.
* **Keep a "family" collection** with a list of medical conditions (e.g. allergies) for each family member, for use in emergencies.
* **Create a list of key accomplishments at the end of each month** as part of the migration process. This is particularly helpful when preparing for performance reviews at work.
