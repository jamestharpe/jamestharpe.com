# Radian

A radian ($rad$) is the angle ($\theta$) which subtends an arc equal to the length of the radius of a [circle](circles.md). The angle of a circle is $2\pi$ radians.

## Convert Between Radians and Degrees

Given there are $360\degree$ in a circle and $2\pi\ rad$ in a circle, we can say $360\degree = 2\pi\ rad$.

You can solve for either side of the equation to determine the formula for conversion.

First, simplify:

$180\degree = \pi\ rad$
