# Structured Query Language (SQL)

**Structured Query Language (SQL)**, sometimes pronounced "sequal", is a [programming language](computer-languages.md) designed to query and manipulate relational data. Though SQL was designed for use with [relational databases](relational-databases.md), many other types of databases can support SQL.
