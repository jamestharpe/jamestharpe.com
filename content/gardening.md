# Gardening

**Gardening** is the practice of growing and cultivating plants for food and aesthetic beauty. Gardening can be done indoors or outdoors, in containers or in the ground.

## Hardiness zones

A **hardiness zone is** a geographic area that encompasses a specific range of climatic conditions relevant to plant cultivation. The [USDA Hardiness Zone Map](https://www.fs.usda.gov/wildflowers/Native_Plant_Materials/Native_Gardening/hardinesszones.shtml) is the standard by which gardeners and growers can determine which plants are most likely to thrive at a location. However, hardiness zones do not account for all factors that can affect a plant's viability such as soil conditions, humidity, precipitation, wind, and the number of days of sunshine.

<!-- The size, location, and exposure to sunlight are key factors in a successful garden. **Full sunlight** is generally defined as 6-8 hours of sunlight per day, **partial shade** generally receives 3-6 hours of sunlight per day, and **full shade** receives less than 3 hours of sunlight per day. -->
