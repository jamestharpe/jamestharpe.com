# 3D Printing

**3D printing** is the process of creating 3-dimensional objects using an additive, such as a plastic (as opposed to a subtractive, such as a CNC machine).

## Process to 3D Print a Design

1. Create or download a 3D design, typically as an STL file.
1. "Slice" the design with a slicer to produce a g-code file.
1. Load the g-code file to the printer

Tips:

* Closely monitor the print as it begins and check on it periodically
* Clean the printer bed between prints with a small amount of rubbing alcohol and a microfiber cloth
* A light dusting of cheap hairspray can improve adhesion, especially for glass beds
* Each filament will specify temperatures and other conditions required for successful prints
* Clean the printer bed between uses with a small amount of alcohol and a microfiber cloth

## 3D Printing Terminology

* **G-code file:** A file that contains the step-by-step instructions
* **Raft:** A horizontal mesh printed before the first layer to improve bed adhesion or strengthen an otherwise weak base structure. Causes a rough finish on the bottom layer. Often used with ABS filament to prevent warping.
* **Slicer:** Software that converts a 3D model into layer-by-layer print instructions.
* **STL file:** A "stereolithography" file that defines a set of 3-dimensional design in a layer-by-layer fashion.
