# American Standard Code for Information Interchange (ASCII)

**ASCII** is standard to encoding text character symbols as binary data for electronic communication. Each character is mapped to a 7-bit code, allowing for 127 characters total ($1111111_{2} = 124_{10}$). The numerical order of these codes is known as **ASCIIbetical order**.

The first 32 codes are reserved as control characters, such as backspace and linefeed. However, the character for `Delete` is the 127th code for historic reasons. The remaining codes are reserved for printable characters including punctuation, symbols, numbers, and letters.
