# Unsupervised Machine Learning

**Unsupervised Machine Learning** is a [type](machine-learning.md) of [machine learning](machine-learning.md) in which patterns within data are derived by a machine learning algorithm. Unlike [supervised learning](ml-supervised-classification-learning.md), training data is not pre-labeled. A common use of unsupervised learning is to use [marketing](marketing.md) and customer [data](data.md) to derive market segments; or, to use credit card transaction data to detect anomalies in purchase patterns that may indicate fraud.
