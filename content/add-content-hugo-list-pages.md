# Hugo List Page Content

When I first [setup my Hugo-based website]({{< ref "setting-up-hugo-website.md" >}}) I relied on [taxonomies]({{< ref "setting-up-hugo-website.md#taxonomy" >}}) to organize content, which resulted in pages that simply list links to other pages. For example:

TODO: Add image here.

To make it easier for both users and search engines to find content, I decided to add some descriptions to each index page.
