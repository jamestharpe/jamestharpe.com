# Functional Programming

**Functional programming** is a declarative programming paradigm in which programs are constructed through the composition of functions, where each function is an expression that returns a value.

## Attributes of Functional Programs

| Attribute             | Description                                                                                                                                                     |

| First Class Functions | Functions can be bound to names, treated as variables, passed as arguments, and returned as the results of other functions                                      |
| Pure Functions        | Functions are deterministic: They always produce the same output from a given input without performing any side-effects (modifying values outside the function) |
