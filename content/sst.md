**Serverless Stack Toolkit (SST)** is an [open-source framework](open-source-software.md) that wraps [Pulumi](pulumi.md) to help manage full-stack applications on [AWS](aws.md) by configuring an application's [infrastructure as code](infrastructure-as-code.md) in a single configuration file. A key feature of SST is that it has pre-built "recipes" for popular frameworks, such as Next, Nuxt, Angular, Svelte, and others.
