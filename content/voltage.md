# Stored Electricity: Voltage and Volts ($V$)

Stored electricity is called voltage and is measured in volts. More precisely, **voltage** is the difference in electric potential energy between two points.

One **volt** is equal to 1 joule ($J$, see [physics](physics.md)) per 1 coulomb ($C$), or $V = \frac{J}{C}$. A [**coulomb**](charge.md) is a quantity of electrical charge (i.e. electrons or protons). Volts can also be expressed in terms of [watts](watts-law.md) and [amps](current.md): $V=W/A$.

Another way to put it is, a volt is the amount of electricity required to accelerate 1kg by 1 meter per second squared (a joule) for 1 second (resulting in a displacement of $1m$), divided by the quantity of electrical charges (coulombs). In other words, a volt is "how much work can be done per coulomb".

Voltage can be derived by [Ohm's Law](ohms-law.md) as $V = IR$.

## Common Voltages

| Source      | Voltage          |
| ----------- | ---------------- |
| AA Battery  | $1.5V$           |
| Car battery | $12V$            |
| Wall socket | $110V$ or $220V$ |

## History

Volts and voltage are both named after [Alessandro Volta](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alessandro_Volta), who invented the first battery in 1800.
