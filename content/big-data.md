# Big data

**Big data** is a blanket term for the [engineering](data-engineering.md) and [analysis](data-analysis.md) challenges that arise from working with extremely large datasets. 

## Common challenges in big data

As [tweeted by Jeff Xiong](https://mobile.twitter.com/gigix/status/174086466950021120): 

> "big data" is when the size of the data itself becomes part of the problem

Common challenges for big data include:

* "Messy" data: Lack of consistent schema, conflicting or missing data
* Unstructured data: Data without any defined structure, such as user reviews
* Data quality: Multiple and unreliable sources, for example crowd-sourced data
* Data availability: Intermittent data sources, for example sensors with limited connectivity
* Data velocity: High-volume transactions, such as server logs for a popular website
* Data size: Datasets that cannot fit on a single storage medium, such as a hard-drive
