# Software Architecture

**Software architecture** is the [software engineering](software-engineering.md) practice of planning, organizing, and evolving the components of a system of applications for optimal interaction. What is "optimal" is determined by the [requirements](requirements.md), constraints, and design goals of the system. Optimizations may include cost, flexibility, scalability, implementation timelines, and various business factors.
