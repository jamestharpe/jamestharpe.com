# Data science

**Data science** is the application of [statistics](statistics.md), [computer science](computer-science.md), and the [scientific method](science.md) to the practice of [data analysis](data-analysis.md) to convert [data](data.md) into [information](information.md), with an emphasis on making accurate predictions.

Data science practices may overlap significantly with [business intelligence](business-intelligence.md), [data engineering](data-engineering.md), and [data analysis](data-analysis.md) practices. However, the primary focus of data science is to apply [machine learning](machine-learning.md) and statistical methods to [data](data.md).

## Data science skills

Broadly speaking, a data science has at least foundational knowledge of science, data analysis, and [programming](software-engineering.md). Depending on the individual, the skill set may be significantly weighted more toward one or two of these skills rather than evenly balanced among all three.
