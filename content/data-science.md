# Data science

**Data science** is the application of [statistics](statistics.md) and the [scientific method](science.md) to the practice of [data analysis](data-analysis.md), with an emphasis on making accurate predictions.

Data science practices may overlap significantly with [business intelligence](business-intelligence.md), [data engineering](data-engineering.md), and [data analysis](data-analysis.md) practices. However, the primary focus of data science is to apply [machine learning](machine-learning.md) and statistical methods to [data](data.md).
