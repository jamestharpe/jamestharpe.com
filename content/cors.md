# Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS)

**Cross-Origin Resource Sharing**, or simply **CORS**, is a security mechanism that allows servers to use HTTP headers to indicate to clients origins it deems valid. Client applications, typically web browsers, then permit or deny loading resources from origins.

## CORS Resources

* [CORS on MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/CORS)
