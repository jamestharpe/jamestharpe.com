# Databases

A **database** is an organized collection of [data](data.md).

## Types of databases

### Document database

A **document database** is a key-value store in which the value consists of semi-structured data that can usually be further queried.

### Graph database

A **graph database** stores records as nodes and defines relationships as edges between nodes.

### Key-value store

A **key-value store** stores data as a hash table, where each key can quickly be queried to return the associated data.

### Relational database

A **relational database** maintains data in a tabular format, where each record in the database is identified by a primary key, and relationships to other records are defined by foreign keys. Most relational databases support SQL based queries.

### Time series database

A **time series database** is optimized to aggregate timestamped data.
