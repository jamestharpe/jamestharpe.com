# Power (Physics)

In [physics](physics.md), **Power** ($P$) is the rate at which work is done (or energy is transferred) over time ($t$). Recall that work is a change in energy, therefore Power is the change in energy ($E$) over the change in time, or $P=\Delta{E}/\Delta{t}$.

Power can be expressed as as the product of force ($F$) and velocity ($V$), or $P=FV$, because force is energy transferred to an object (a change in energy) and velocity is the change in position over time (a change in time).

Power is measured in [watts](watts-law.md). One **watt** is equal to 1 joule per second, or $W=J/s$.
