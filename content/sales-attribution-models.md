# Sales Attribution Models

**Sales attribution models** are used in [data analysis](data-analysis.md) to determine how much credit is assigned to different [marketing](marketing.md) and [advertising](advertising.md) efforts to generate sales. Some of the most common sales attribution models include:

* **First-click attribution**: Assigns all credit for a sale to the first marketing touchpoint that the customer interacted with.
* **Last-click attribution**: Assigns all credit for a sale to the last marketing touchpoint that the customer interacted with.
* **Linear attribution**: Assigns equal credit to each marketing touchpoint that the customer interacted with on their journey to making a purchase.
* **Time decay attribution**: Assigns more credit to marketing touchpoints that occurred closer in time to the sale.
* **U-shaped attribution**: Assigns more credit to the first and last marketing touchpoints, with less credit given to intermediate touchpoints.
* **W-shaped attribution**: Assigns more credit to the first, middle, and last touchpoints, with less credit given to touchpoints in between.
