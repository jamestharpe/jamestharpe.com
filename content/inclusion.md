# Inclusion

**Inclusion** is the engagement, respect, and support of individuals in a group such as a team, company, or governing body. If [diversity](diversity.md) is "having a seat at the table" then inclusion is "having a voice at the table." An environment is considered "inclusive" when individuals from distinct cohorts report similar ability to share ideas with their peers and leadership.

A common rule to ensure an environment is inclusive is that "if you're not intentionally including, you're probably accidentally excluding."
