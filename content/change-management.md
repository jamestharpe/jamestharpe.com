# Change Management

**Change management** is the application of a structured approach to transition an organization from its current state to a desired future state. Effective change management not only reduces the risk of changes being rejected, but also helps ensure changes accurately target their objectives.

## Roles and Responsibilities in Change Management

* A **change management lead** is [accountable and responsible](raci.md) for the change strategy. They assess the change needed, outline an [implementation plan](project-management.md), and oversee the execution of the plan.
* A **change sponsor** is an individual or group that defines and promotes the change goals, is accountable for benefit realization, and serve as the ultimate authority on decision making and funding.
* **Change agents** are charged with modeling behaviors required for successful change and giving feedback on changes.
* A **change management team** designs and develops the tools for change adoption. The team gathers and aggregates feedback, conducts training, and communicates changes to those who are impacted.
* A **change management practitioner** coordinates and tracks change management activities.

## Change Management Terminology

* **Adoption** is acceptance and demonstration of new ways of thinking or behaving that are consistent with future state behavior
* A **benefit** is a quantitative or qualitative desirable outcome that results from a change
* **Benefit realization** is the achievement of the expected benefits of a change
*  **Current state** is the condition of a system at the time when change is initiated, or simply put it's the "status quo"
 * **Future state** is the condition of a system at the time when the benefits of a change have been realized
