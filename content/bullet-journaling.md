# Bullet Journaling

Bullet Journaling is a modular set of practices for personal organization. These practices organize schedules, reminders, task lists, ideas, and other organizational artifacts into a single notebook. Though journals are typically handwritten, digital journals can also benefit from the organizational methods and practices of bullet journaling.

## Structure of a Bullet Journal

A bullet journal is made up of collections. A **collection** is a set of closely related information. A bullet journal is made up of four core collections; however, more collections can be added based on the individual journaler's needs.

### Core Bullet Journal Collections

1. **Index.** A chronologically ordered list of all the collections in the journal, except the daily log collections.
1. **Future Log.** A calendar of events and tasks that will occur outside the current month.
1. **Monthly Log.** A specialized collection to organize the events and tasks of a particular month. Minimally, it consists of the
1. **Daily Log.** A place to rapid-log tasks, events, and notes as they occur throughout the day.

### Custom Collections

**Custom collections** are created to meet some specific need. For example, to plan a project or to track a fitness routine.

## Rapid Logging

**Rapid logging** is the practice of quickly jotting-down notes in a bulleted-list format, typically within the daily log. Specialized bullets and signifiers are used to distinguish between different types of notes. Types of notes are typically tasks, events, or information; however the journaler may choose to invent their own types of notes as well.

### Common Bullets

| `o`    | Event       | Something that happened or is scheduled to happen        |
| `—`    | Information | Something worth remembering. Facts, ideas, observations. |

### Bullet States

| Notation           | Term       | Definition                        | Applies to  |

### Common Signifiers

| Signifier | Term        | Definition                                 |
| --------- | ----------- | ------------------------------------------ |
| `*`       | Important   | Signifies special importance or priority   |
| `!`       | Inspiration | Signifies inspirational ideas and insights |

## Bullet Journal Practices

Bullet journal practices are intended to maintain focus on what matters through daily and monthly reviews intended to refine task lists and reflect on what matters.

### Daily Review

Spend about 5 - 15 minutes to review notes from the past day, update with status and signifiers as necessary, and create the **daily log** for the day ahead. Do this at either the very beginning or very end of each day.

### Monthly Migrations

At the end of each month, create a new **monthly log** for the month ahead. Start by creating the layout for the next month, then review the previous month to:

* Mark completed tasks with `✖`.
* ~~Cross-out~~ irrelevant tasks, notes, and events.
* For tasks you plan to complete next month, mark them as migrated (`>`) and add them to the next month's task list or to the relevant **custom collection**.
* For tasks you plan to complete after next month, move them to the future log and mark them as scheduled (`<`).

The goal is that all relevant tasks have been copied to the next month's task list, the future log, or a custom collection.
