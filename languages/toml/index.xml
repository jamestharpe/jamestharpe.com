      <description>Moving my Website to Hugo I&amp;rsquo;ve decided to move my website off of WordPress and on to a static site generator. After building sites for several clients using Jekyll, I thought it would be nice to try something new.
Since my website has been very neglected, most of the content is outdated so I&amp;rsquo;m not going to bother moving much of it over. If I were, I might try the wordpress-to-hugo-exporter exporter.</description>
